Hope wanted to make a program that uses speech-to-text to monitor vocabulary usage.
This will rely upon libraries for audio I/O and speech recognition.  The data will be
captured in a key-value database. We could try adding graphics capability to show the
usage distribution of common vocabulary words.

This could be a cool project to present at school for some extra credit.
